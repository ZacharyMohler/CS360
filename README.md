# CS360 Mobile Architecture & Programming

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The application I designed was based upon requirements presented to me in a 'hypothetical scenario'. The scenario was that a company owned a warehouse for storing their goods. The application was requested to hold information about items they had such as item name, description, and the quantity on hand. 

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The requirements involved minimal UI constraints. I approached this by creating a simplistic, yet effective design scheme with a pleasant color scheme. This allowed for users to utilize the app without the UI being distracting from the data on screen which took priority over all other elements. 

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My approach to coding this application was first to research SQLite as I had no previous experience with it but needed it to be able to complete the application. I then developed the simple UI of the application using Android Studio's xml code feature, using the preview display to ensure things looked roughly correct. Only then did I program the logic of the application to ensure the functionality met the requirements.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I used 100% manual testing for this application, as I am not familiar with Android Studio to implement any other testing methods. With each new feature I developed, I would run the application in the built-in emulator and test constraints to ensure they behaved properly. Only when the application seemed to be working properly would I hook up a physical device to test it on actual hardware. This process is of upmost importance as it ensures your application actually works.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The biggest challenge I overcame during this process was to learn and successfully implement SQLite in the application. I was previously unfamiliar with SQLite so learning it's syntax and its relative java syntax was very difficult, but very informative and satisfying to complete.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Again, my implementation of SQLite, as it shows my ability to complete a daunting task within an already unfamiliar IDE (Android Studio
